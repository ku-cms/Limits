# Limits

Framework to create limit comparison plots.

Requirements: Python 3 with numpy and matplotlib.

Download repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ku-cms/Limits.git
cd Limits
```

Create limit comparison plots using this command:
```
python3 python/makePlots.py
```

Input data is stored in "data," and plots should be created in "plots."

Currently, there are functions to create comparison plots for the following simplified models:
- TSlepSlep
- TChiWZ
- T2ttC
- Higgsino
